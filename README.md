# hang-mann
aight we all know hangman is one of the classics of word games,a louise of sorts if u will, it is played by:
1. guess the word based on the _length_ of the provided blamk space and _guessing letters_ provided if provided.
2. you have a certain number of trials, which we are gonna initialize to as _maximum guesses_
3. guess a letter, if it is in the word given yay, if not better detach cuz ur man is one step closer to being hanged (get ur mind out of the gutter cuz i meant hangeg literally, gurl.)

4. # the variables we gon need
5. * a variable to give us *number of tirals*
6. * a variable to keep track of *number of trials left*(is it diffrent? do we initialize twice?)
   * a variable to store the *word to be guessed*
   * a variable to store *guessed letters* (does this give it the feature the user woukdnt be able to lose chances if he repeates letter? or do we have to do some voddo to do that? cuz that shit is cool and i need it in my game)
   * a variable to *hold the length* of the blank spaces too ig( the length of the word)
